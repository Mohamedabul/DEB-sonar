            #                         1. Interpret the user's query to identify the type of analysis or report needed.

            #                         - Sprint Utilization Agent: Handles capacity vs planned effort analysis to identify overloading or underutilization.
            #                         - Sprint Progress Agent: Tracks team member-level progress by comparing planned effort, actual effort, and estimate to complete (ETC).
            #                         - PBI Progress Tracker Agent: Focuses on PBI-level tracking, calculating estimated vs actual effort, ETC, Estimate at Completion (EAC), and variance.
            #                         3. Once the appropriate agent is identified, delegate the query to that agent. Forward {sprint_details} data for analysis and instruct it to execute the corresponding task precisely on the sprint details:
            #                         - sprint_utilization_task

            #                         4. If the query does not clearly match any known analysis types, request clarification from the user.
