                        1. Sprint Planning : 
                            - In sprint planning segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'Not Started'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Sprint planning plots plus their explanation need to come under this segment. Plots like 'Total Capacity vs Estimated Effort vs Available Capacity' come under this segment.
                        2. Sprint Execution : 
                            - In sprint execution segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'In Progress'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Right now there are no plots that come under this segment.
                        3. Sprint End: 
                            - In sprint end segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'Completed'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Sprint end plots plus their explanation need to come under this segment. Plots like 'Sprint End Utilization','Sprint End Variance' come under this segment.
                    - Always present the analysis table exactly the same way present in `initial_analysis_report.md`, do not add more sprints or metrics to original table. Stick to what is provided, don't modify the table.
                    - Finally in the end of the report provide critical findings and recommendations.
                    - Avoid redundancy by embedding same plots again and again. 
                    - Always keep the tone professional, positive, and engaging. Avoid casual or blunt language.
                    - Make use to appropriate emojis whereever needed.
                    - Include all content from `initial_analysis_report.md`, especially the analysis table containing all numbers and metrics:
                        * Do **not** truncate or modify analysis table.
                        * Format as **aligned ASCII table** within triple backticks ```bash.
                    - Explain **all metrics and formulas** used (e.g., Sprint Utilization = Estimated Effort / Capacity * 100).
                    - Include and embed **only** the images from the `images` folder. Do not modify the paths of those images. Keep them as is.
                    - If you're adding new content to the report, do not reference or embed images that were not read by the tool and don't exist in images folder. This causes broken image links in the final report. Avoid such issues.       
                    - Do **not** include any other plots like Team_Utilization_Heatmap or Workload_Distribution from your end, stick to the plots that are provided to you.
                    - For each image:
                        * Embed using `![](images/filename.png)`
                        * Provide detailed interpretation: explain what the plot shows, who is over/under-utilized, and what decisions can be made.
                    - Ensure the number of images matches exactly the number present in the `images` folder.
                    - Format the report in **GitHub-style markdown**, like a polished README.
                    - Do **not** include Introduction, Executive Summary, or Conclusion.
                    - Ensure there are no gaps â€” connect all text, tables, and visuals into a seamless narrative.

                    Think like a project manager: organize, explain, and narrate the data in a way that helps decision-making. Tie all visuals, tables, and metrics into a clear analytical story.

                    Guidelines:
                    - First thing in the report needs to the analysis table and well defined key performance metrics.              
                    - Then organize the middle of the report by breaking down into three main segments:
                        1. Sprint Planning : 
                            - In sprint planning segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'Not Started'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Sprint planning plots plus their explanation need to come under this segment. Plots like 'Total Capacity vs Estimated Effort vs Available Capacity', 'Distribution_of_allocated_work_across_team_members' etc come under this segment.
                        2. Sprint Execution : 
                            - In sprint execution segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'In Progress'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Right now there are no plots that come under this segment.
                        3. Sprint End: 
                            - In sprint end segment perform analysis only on sprints where Status is 'Completed'. No other sprints to be included.
                            - Sprint end plots plus their explanation need to come under this segment. Plots like 'Sprint End Utilization','Sprint End Variance','Team Allocation(%) At Sprint End' etc come under this segment. 
                    - Always present the analysis table exactly the same way present in `initial_analysis_report.md`, do not add more sprints or metrics to original table. Stick to what is provided, don't modify the table.
